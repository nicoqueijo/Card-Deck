 PSEUDOCODE:
 
 1. Validate the command-line arguments entered by the user.
		We first must verify that exactly two command-line arguments were
		specified. If not print an appropriate error message and exit the
		program.
		Once we have verified that we received 2 command-line arguments we 
		must assure that both of these arguments are in the form of positive
		integers. If they are not print an appropriate error message and exit
		the program. 
		Once we have verified that both of the received arguments are positive
		integers, assure that they are each within the range of 1-13. If either
		one is not in that range print an appropriate error message and exit the
		program.
		Once we have verified that both integers are in the range of 1-13 we 
		must verify that their product does not exceed 52. If it does print an
		appropriate error message and exit the program.
		
2. Create the original deck with the 52 ordered cards.
		We can do this by creating a 3D array where the first two dimensions
		represent the rows and columns of the deck. The last dimension represents
		the suit and rank of the card.
	
3. Display the original, ordered deck to the console.
		This can be done by traversing the deck array and printing out each
		card to the console.
	
4. Shuffle the original deck to randomize the card order.
		This can be done by traversing the deck and swapping each card with a 
		another random card in the deck.
		
5. Display the now shuffled deck to the console.
		This can be done by traversing the deck array and printing out each
		card to the console.
		
6. Deal the cards to the players in the game.
		For this we will need the information we validated in step one. In step
		one we gathered the cards per hand and the number of players participating
		in the game. To perform this deal of cards we can traverse through the
		deck of cards and give each player x cards where x is the cards per hand
		value. This will be stored as its own entity in another 3D array.
		
7. Display the hands to the console.
		To display the hands to the console we can simply traverse the array we
		are using to store the hands and print each card of each player.
